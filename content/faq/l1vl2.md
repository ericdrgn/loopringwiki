# L1 v. L2

## Description

- Put simply Layer 1 is the underlying blockchain for any Layer 2 solution. In the case of Loopring Layer 1 is the Ethereum Blockchain. Layer 2 solutions build on top of Layer 1.
- Loopring's Layer 2 solution is a zero knowledge rollup also known as a ZK-Rollup. This solution bundles many transfers off-chain into a single transaction via a smart contract. The reason this type of system is cheaper and faster is because it provides the proof instead of ALL the data that Layer 1 typically includes.

## Why is Layer 2 Needed?

- Transaction times on Layer 1 are slow and don't make sense when a fast transfer is needed. Loopring's L2 solution is near instant, blink and you will miss it. 
- Gas Fees are astronomically high. As Ethereum continues to be used the gas fees for using the blockchain are getting more and more prohibitive. Loopring's L2 solution solves this problem by having fees that are negligible in comparison.
