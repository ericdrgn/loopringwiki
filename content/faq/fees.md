# Fees

## Layer 1 Versus Layer 2

### Layer 1 Fees

- Fees on L1 are entirely outside the scope of what Loopring can control. When using our Wallet App or Exchange when transacting on L1 you will be paying the gas fees that are currently being charged by Ethereum miners to keep the blockchain running.
- Sites like ETH Gas Station (https://ethgasstation.info/) can help you visualize current gas fees and help you determine when to move assets on L1 when there is a dip.

### Layer 2 Fees

- Fees on L2 are considerably lower than the fees required when transacting on L1 due to Loopring's ZK-Rollup bundling a lot more transactions into one. This allows the transactions to be implemented faster and in a significantly cheaper way. 
- Please keep in mind that we are unable to control the fees to onboard to Layer 2 (L1 to L2) but after you are on Layer 2 please enjoy the low fees!

## Using Points

- Loopring Points are not a currency or a coin like LRC. Loopring Points can be earned in various ways such as signing in daily to the Loopring Wallet App. These points cannot be traded for any other currency but they can be used to cover the cost of fees on Layer 1 or Layer 2. Points cannot be split with other currencies but if you do have enough points to cover the entirety of fees for any given transaction you will be able to select them as your "payment method".
