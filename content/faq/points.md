# Points

## Earning

Points can be earned right now by signing in daily to the Loopring Wallet app! After enough days in a row your points will reach 100 points per day of signing in. If you forget a day it will start over but rest assured you will be able to get back to 100 points in no time!

## Using

Loopring Points can be used to pay any fee within the Loopring Wallet. If you have enough Points in your balance to cover any given fee you will have the option to select Loopring Points as the method to cover the cost of the fee. Right now you are unable to use Loopring Points alongside another method (LRC, ETH, etc).
