# Wallet Overview

Completely self-custodial, only you control your assets. And say goodbye to seed phrases and paper backups. You can choose people, institutions, and hardware that you trust as the guardians of your wallet. If you ever lose access to your mobile, they can help you recover all your assets. As long as more than half of your guardians are trustworthy, your assets are secure. You can also set limits on daily transfers, and lock it down if ever needed.

## Fast & Cheap

Loopring Wallet integrates Loopring's zkRollup layer-2 scaling protocol to raise speeds and lower fees by 1000x, while inheriting the absolute same security guarantees as Ethereum mainnet. Loopring provides a trading experience like Robinhood or Binance, a payment experience like Alipay or Venmo, but with the power and permissionlessness of Ethereum. Best of both worlds: traditional speed and cost efficiency & Ethereum security, opportunity, and global reach.
